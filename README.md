PISA is an international exam taken every three years by fifteen year olds in the subjects of language arts, math, and science. 
In 2018, Mexico ranked well below the global average and the progress in its grades have stagnated, showing the worsening state of the mexican education system.

This program was made as a school project to help students learn and improve on their scores. 
This is the first of two parts and it is dedicated to the language arts part, more specifically, learning eight grade spelling, taken from the vocabulary of a spelling contest.

The program consists of picking the correct word spelling out of two options. If the correct option was selected, the word will not show again, otherwise the word will appeaar two more times. 
This program is done when the eight sets are completed with their 500/500 score.
